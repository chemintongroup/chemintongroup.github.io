*In terms of geography, population, economy and resources, China
is naturally a major country with a long history and complex national
conditions. After more than 30 years of reform and opening-up, the
economy has developed rapidly.*

Written by Jin Canrong, a well-known expert on international
studies, this book has a unique and well-founded view. In
his view, the China issue is indeed very complicated and
cannot be easily explained by some people. In his own
words, "Whoever can explain the China problem well will
win the Nobel Prize."
